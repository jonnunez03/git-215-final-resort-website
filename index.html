                Escape from everyday life and spend a few warm and relaxing days
                in with us. Enjoy the refreshing mountain air. Discover the
                village and the surrounding mountains on foot or with our bikes.
                Visit our spa or ski runs during a winter visit, or take a
                guided hike during the warmer months. We offer something for
                everyone!

              <p>
                Whether you prefer a snowy mountain escape or a peaceful summer
                getaway surrounded by verdant mountains and valleys, we have it
                all. You can hit the slopes and build a snowman in the winter,
                and you can head out for a hike, picnics, and swimming in the
                spring and summer. Escape the ordinary with us!
